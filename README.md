# Periodic-Table-in-C
We have 118 elements in our Periodic Table. And every element has different properties. Also eachh element belongs to certain category according to any classification by which we can study the change in properties. 

But one may find it difficult to track different properties of each element or get all properties of any element using its name or atomic number or atomic symbol or classify the elements according to their metallic classification or block.

Therefore an interactive periodic table is developed using C language using which the user can do above things very easily.
